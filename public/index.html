          "content": "LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) is a software based solution, providing an information management system for laboratories. It includes a set of key features which supports the operations of a modern laboratory.\nSpecifications of the LIMS Software LIMS offers comprehensive reports for the organization and relevant structured information. It also incorporates with other applications as well, such as ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning). These services maximize the efficiency of a business.\nThe system offers flexible architecture, data tracking system, workflow and data exchange services. These services support use in regulated environments.\nLIMS offers a number of benefits to laboratory management, including better data quality and increased productivity. Both of these factors reduce operating costs, which simultaneously save valuable human resources from daily tasks.\nThey easily adopt the procedures followed in the laboratory, such as single sample, batch samples and automated or manual methods. They generate reports for external or internal customer use. Resource Management is the key aspect that helps to plan allocation of work.\nLiteral Scope of the definition of LIMS The literal definition of LIMS has become controversial over the years because the laboratories and their information management require rapid shifting. The needs of the modern laboratories are variably different and the requirements from a laboratory information management system also changes. Thus the definition of LIMS is totally dependent on its user.\nLIMS usually targets research, environmental or commercial analysis, for example, petrochemical or pharmaceutical work. Recently, LIMS products have expanded far beyond their original rationale of sample management.\nThere are many features added to numerous LIMS products such as data analysis, data mining, assay data management and electronic laboratory notebook (ELN). These features facilitate the recognition of transitional medicine with a single software solution.\nLIMS Sample Management in LIMS The main function of LIMS is the management of samples received. The process starts just after a sample is received in the laboratory. First, the sample is registered with the LIMS. During the registration procedure, a bar code is attached to the sample. Many other parameters are also recorded such as, phenotypic or clinical information that match with the sample.\nInstrument and application integration in LIMS Today, the updated LIMS offers an unending amount of integration with laboratory applications and instruments. The LIMS also develops control files which are integrated into the instrument and lead its operation on different physical objects, such as the sample plate or sample tube.\nThe access to laboratory instruments might be synchronized based upon the sequence of custody assignments and other security features. Any new developments in the LIMS products will be their aptitude to import and supervise raw assay data results.\nElectronic data exchange in LIMS The exponentially increasing data volumes in laboratories are incorporated with increased business demands and greater focus on profitability. This has encouraged LIMS vendors to look after how their LIMS manages the electronic data exchanges.\nStress should be placed upon the management of input and output of the data, importing/exporting of remote sample collection and the integration of tablet technology and PDA\u0026rsquo;s with the LIMS. The transfer of files through Microsoft Excel and other formats, and the import/export of data to SQL, Oracle and Microsoft Access Databases is a crucial aspect of the modern LIMS.\n",

          "content": "One of the most difficult problems laboratories deal with is effective management of their equipment. This is not meant to imply that people in labs are out there sneaking the lab’s equipment out under their jackets or in their backpacks. It merely means that keeping track of the records on the equipment can be problematic. Very few Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) are capable to manage such data for equipment. The labs that do have equipment managing LIMS have found them to be extremely valuable to their facilities efficiency. Let’s face it! If the equipment is not maintained at the proper times, the value of the data is compromised. LIMS ABC is a leading provider of Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) and is one of the few LIMS providers that offer LIMS with equipment management capabilities.\nManaging Equipment Maintenance with LIMS There isn’t a piece of mechanical equipment that has been created that doesn’t require regular maintenance.

It is of the utmost importance that you know about the safety, reliability and security of the Laboratory Information Management Systems that you are considering. These are paramount characteristics that must be taken into consideration. In order for a LIMS to have all of these properties, you will need to spend some time looking at the various LIMS software available on the market today. In the end, you will certainly find that LIMS ABC has everything that you need and expect in a Laboratory Information Management System.\nThe Two Important Elements There are two incredibly important elements when it comes to the safety, reliability and security of Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS). They are the implementation programming language and the operating system. The programming language simply must have the ability to handle defensive programming. Without this, you could be dead in the water. In order for the programming language to be completely viable, it should be capable of garbage collection, exception handling and variable typing. The operating system should be able to monitor, regulate and ensure that the LIMS system is not accessed by unauthorized users.\nUser IDs and Passwords for LIMS Software Most Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) provide for the typical user IDs and passwords for security. This can be quite fragile. Consideration must be given to the fact that users often forget their own passwords as well as there are \u0026ldquo;sniffing\u0026rdquo; techniques that can divulge users\u0026rsquo; passwords. By ensuring that the users keep their passwords safe and that they change them weekly can help to protect the data. A LIMS software with capabilities for digital signatures can also help to authenticate the user and data for the system. Of course, voice recognition, finger printing or retinal scans would be a bonus for keeping data secure.\nThe Right LIMS System for Your Lab The professionals at LIMS ABC care about the needs of each and every laboratory with which they work. They do all that they can to ensure that your data is safe and secure from nary-do-wells.

          "content": "A medical facility’s main concern is always taking care of their patients and doing the best they can to ensure that they stay in good health. Years ago, maintaining records was done manually with a chart kept on the patients’ bed or in a slot on the door to their hospital rooms. Although the medical personnel did their best to maintain the records, a lot of data went without recording. This was unacceptable then, and it is unacceptable now. A cloud LIMS that can connect to mobile devices such as iPads, Androids and other tablets is a priceless commodity in the medical field. LIMS ABC provides medical facilities with top of the line LIMS software that works with mobile devices.\nCloud LIMS for Medical Facilities There are so many benefits for a medical facility acquiring cloud LIMS software.

The companies can then use that money to find new targets.\nQuality Management in LIMS LIMS software manages lots, cases and batches efficiently. The system includes the practicality to maintain results validation, approval and certification, thus ensuring the highest quality of products. Different batches and lots can be accepted or rejected, depending upon the customers\u0026rsquo; criteria.

With LIMSABC for Toxicology we wanted to develop a tool that would integrate everything in a requisition-centric fashion from physician, with the client web portal, to laboratory operations to medical billing and coding; a fully integrated practice management solution.\nAll the information you need is now in your LIS system from demographics and insurance to tests ordered - why go to a separate system to generate claims and send to a clearinghouse? As part of our Integrated Practice Management solution, physicians’ offices create new requisitions on a shared screen, so you can immediately review them and add missing information, upload scanned documents, and take pictures of insurance cards to store all of the required information with the requisition. At the end of the process, the final report is approved and sent to the client, and a claim is automatically generated based on tests ordered and insurance carrier information.\nTools to Enable Medical Billing and Coding from LIMSABC If the physician’s office enters insurance information by scanning an insurance card rather than entering data manually, no problem. When developing the claim process, we added image recognition to pull the readable text right off of the card. This enables you to reduce manual data entry and only requires your billing staff to verify that the information is correct and to update it as needed.\nEnter data directly from an Insurance Card with Image Analysis Tools\nFurthermore, we made checking insurance benefits much easier by integrating them into LIMSABC, so you aren’t required to go to a separate system to check a patient’s benefits, plan, deductible, and deductible paid. It’s all right there at your fingertips.\nCheck Patient Benefit Information Directly from LIMSABC\nNow you have all the tools you need to work the claim, including an approval workflow to ensure the proper steps are taken before you submit it to the clearinghouse.You can work the claim through the claim manager; make any necessary adjustments, scrub the claim, track outstanding balances and insurance and patient responsibilities, and keep track of what has already been paid as well as any writeoffs. We also support sending and receiving of electronic 837 and 835 forms.\n",

          "content": " The days of paper-based and manual laboratory data management are over. It has become glaringly obvious with the recent COVID-19 pandemic that every laboratory, no matter how small, needs to be able to respond quickly when a public health crisis requires a change in collections, testing and reporting. It is essential that every laboratory be working with a Laboratory Information System (LIS) that can help them do that and not be another roadblock to efficiency.\nLIMSABC is proud to report that several of our clients have been contributing to the testing effort from the very early days of the crisis in the US. While many labs are still struggling to adjust their systems to accommodate the coronavirus testing requirements, our clients were able to configure and validate their systems for COVID-19 testing in a matter of hours, not days or weeks. There were no special updates needed, no downloads to wait for and no fees that needed to be approved and contracted before they were able to jump in to assist with the nationwide testing and reporting.\nSolaris Diagnostics, a CLIA-accredited laboratory in Nicholasville, KY was one of the first in the nation to provide COVID-19 testing to their clients. Dr. Preetpal Sidhu, CEO of Solaris, and John Drury, Director of Operations, lead the project to prepare their lab for the critical testing including modifications to the LIS to accommodate the new testing.\n“We went from an average of 250 samples per day to over 1200 per day in a matter of just a few days. After a couple weeks we have been able to scale up to 4000 specimens a day and the system was able to keep up.” said Drury. Understandably, there were challenges in adjusting workflows and resources to accommodate the surge in accessioning, but Solaris quickly worked through those and the LIMSABC system easily adjusted to changes in processes that were needed. “Implementing the changes in the system for COVID-19, including configuring, testing and reporting changes, only took a few days.” according to Drury. “The support of LIMSABC and the scalability and flexibility of the system was instrumental in our success.”\nDr. Sidhu appreciates that his LIMSABC system was able to adapt quickly to the testing and reporting rules that were needed for the COVID-19 testing. He also feels that the ability for the submitter portal to be quickly redesigned to highlight positive COVID-19 results “was a big help to our clients who could quickly review their list of submissions and focus on the COVID positive results without having to review each and every report.”\nThe COVID-19 crisis demonstrated the need for systems that can adjust and adapt to any change to lab operations, whether driven by an emerging healthcare situation or by constantly changing business requirements. It proves that a robust, modern LIS is an essential part of a lab’s workflow and, as such, is no longer a luxury for some but essential for all.\n",

          "content": " We built our web portal to be both secure and easy to use so your physicians would find value in working with it. Often portals combine a series of disjointed requirements or have been built as an afterthought, which means they have quirks that clients must work with or work around. Many portals are built using old technology and simply are not able to take advantage of modern web functionality and user experience.\nWe made our portal to be a seamless extension of LIMSABC, a place where each of your clients can come and easily enter new requisitions and access all of their information. Our portal can also be used as a stand alone system that interfaces to existing LIS systems through HL7 integration.\nA Portal Built for Ease of Use We built our portal using a modern LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python) stack and use industry-leading cloud partners such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft to host our solution so you always have world-class uptime, accessibility and scalability. Our underlying technology enables us to offer to offer a full web experience to your clients.\nWe designed everything to be easy and intuitive to reduce the barrier to your client’s adoption. We streamlined the interface to display only the items that your clients need, arranged in a way that logically follows their information requirements and workflow. For example, our home screen lists only new reports, and displays previously viewed or downloaded reports in a different view, so that when clients log in they have their most current information at their fingertips. They can batch download all or selected reports based on client, physician, site, and other values.\nWe streamlined the requisition process and created patient, client and physician databases so that LIMSABC electronically populates each requisition with as much information as possible. For example, patient insurance information is added from existing patient data, and medical tests are included from the physician’s profile or the practices’ profile. Since every item is not digital, we included interfacing with image scanners. After you scan supporting information that appears on hard copy, the system saves the scanned image to file and automatically attaches it or otherwise uses it in the requisition. When you save the requisition, the barcode for the sample automatically prints for easy tracking.\nA Portal Built for Your Clients To ensure that all the information your clients need is at their fingertips, we built the following features and more into our Client Web Portal:\n  Electronic requisitioning\n  Full patient database with patient demographics and insurance information\n  Barcode generation and printing\n  Batch downloading of all new or selected reports\n  Panel, test, and ICD code selection\n  Scanning, imaging, and uploading of supporting information\n  Ability to view each requisition’s status\n  Easy access to new reports and batch downloads\n  Patient analyte trend data\n  Positive summary reports over selected time ranges\n  Bi-directional HL7 interfacing to your existing LIS, EMR’s, billing and other systems\n  Fully web enabled access from any device, anywhere - no local software required\n  Learn more LIMSABC Client Web Portal\n",

          "content": "Toxicology LIS software is advantageous to busy lab facilities. Though overwhelmed lab technicians are aware that the work they do offers answers and diagnoses for patients; busy toxicology labs may have a difficult time analyzing the samples received on a daily basis. Careful analysis requires time that busy doctors and patients are not necessarily willing to wait for however; when recording results for life threatening illness and disease, or simple mandatory drug testing for employment, are dependent upon extremely careful recording. Time is critical in a lab environment. Cloud LIS software is one way to minimize time spent recording information so that more time can be spent analyzing cultures. A fully functional LIS system simplifies the recording process allowing the lab technician to use a few simple keystrokes verses page after page of data entry. This also allows physicians and medical facilities the ability to access the information more quickly and patient anxiety will be put to rest more easily. LIMSABC is the premiere provider of toxicology LIS software worldwide.\nCloud LIS Technology for Tracking Advantages Toxicology LIS software has the ability to track and calculate patient information consistently. This impressive LIS software is available through Cloud technology, and can be accessed immediately to provide patient results and medical care immediately. Cloud LIMS technology can store patient information, care, medications and lab results; accessible with only a few keystrokes. These advantages allow more time to be spent with the patient for care, instead of trying to access the information through different media and communication devices. Toxicology LIS from LIMSABC allows access to important data even through mobile devices such as iPads and Android tablets.\nToxicology LIS Helps Your Lab Help You A lab that is more efficient creates a more efficient medical and physician’s facility. Because toxicology LIS minimizes the time needed for data entry for physicians and lab techs, maximizes the time allotted each patient or test creating a more productive work environment with less labor at higher performance rates. This could also create more time slots for additional patients and lab work. Toxicology LIS software virtually eliminates many errors that may occur through handwritten referrals and lab requests. The software eradicates the need for written orders and results. Any medical facility, great or small, would benefit using cloud LIS toxicology software.

          "content": "Working in a lab may seem like a job that is not really people-oriented in that many technicians are needed to simply run the tests and results instead of actually taking samples however; lab work is always a people-oriented business. Test results can mean the difference in getting the right medication, and not needing medication or treatment at all. Toxicology labs always want to be able to give everyone the best possible care. LIMSABC is dedicated to helping toxicology labs and medical facilities improve patient care and treatment with state of the art cloud LIS software.\nClient Care Streamlined with Cloud LIS Software Lab results must often travel through numerous channels and hands before they reach the point in which they are needed. Most times this occurs in a timely manner, but not always. Cloud LIS software streamlines this process so that the lab orders, results, and everything in between are available at the push of a button or two. Toxicology LIS software allows the user to forego manual entry of a great deal of information as everything is entered on the computer or mobile device. This can cut down on human error due to bad handwriting or poor memory. This also means that patient point of care can be tracked in addition to tracking prescription medication for each client. These simple additions can keep patients healthier because the process is much faster. LIMSABC offers greater patient care with cloud LIMS software for toxicology labs.\nFurther Advantages with Toxicology The advantages of toxicology do not stop with the patients. Cloud software allows users to make reports available online in a public or private manner with the security measures of HIPAA ensured. This means that given the access and the right credentials, patient data can be accessed as needed by those providing care. The system also allows for EMR integration and client and project management. Beyond just the toxicology lab results, software allows for the recording of ICD-9 and ICD-10 information. Even after the patient is discharged, the advantages of a cloud software system continue. The system allows for HL7 billing integration with the ability to manage insurance providers. This can help organize your lab while helping keep patients healthy, even if the lab techs never meet those individuals. The toxicology from LIMSABC makes the lab facility run much more smoothly.\nA Brighter Future with LIMSABC New technology can be overwhelming and scary to users, especially a cloud system that covers as much as LIMSABC’s software. Toxicology lab technicians needn’t worry. The toxicology software from LIMSABC is designed to be user friendly and benefit all those who need to use it.

          "content": "LIMS technology has come a long way over the past few decades and right now, the improvements and developments are being created in leaps and bounds. Unfortunately, many of the Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS) software developers merely set their focus on generic labs therefore; they completely ignore the specific needs of toxicology labs. The truth is that in order to develop LIS software for drug screening labs, developers need to understand the needs of toxicology lab facilities. LIMSABC has taken the time to learn exactly what the needs of toxicology labs are simply by working closely with the drug screening labs’ personnel, so LIMSABC could develop cloud LIS software specifically for toxicology labs.\nEMR Integrated LIS Software for Drug Screening Labs For years medical facilities kept patient records manually in paper files. More often than not, this led to misplaced information or data that went unrecorded. Electronic medical records are much more reliable and easier to maintain. Cloud LIS software that is completely EMR integrated will also enable the toxicology lab to be more efficient. The LIS users will be able to document drug screening results and add them directly to the records. This will save a considerable amount of time and increase the efficiency of the toxicology lab. LIMSABC’s cloud LIS software developers are dedicated to making drug screening labs as efficient as possible.\nDrug Screening Labs Increase Efficiency with Toxicology LIS The incredible advancement of cloud LIS software has made toxicology labs much more productive and accurate than they have been in the past. One of the ways that efficiency is increased is through EMR integration. The ability to access and input drug screening results directly onto the electronic medical records (EMR) eliminates many wasted man hours. The ability for the LIS software users to quickly access and input data onto the EMR proves to be beneficial to the toxicology lab, as well as the facility that contracted the drug screening services. LIMSABC is the premiere toxicology LIS software provider for drug screening labs globally.\nThe Future Is Here with LIMSABC’s Toxicology LIS LIMSABC is not only providing cloud toxicology LIS software that is the most advanced right now, but offers drug screening LIS that will continue to work well into the future.

          "content": "When we began building LIMSABC, we wanted to create a solution that wasn’t just current today but would be a platform for future growth and could evolve as laboratory IT needs and demands changed. When we looked at the pace of change over the last 10 years, we realized the trajectory going forward would require laboratory information systems to refresh their underlying technology. Tomorrow’s laboratories require the ability to work with far more data than they have in the past and need the ability to integrate and work with data from an ever increasing number of data sources; electronic medical records, clearinghouses, billing systems, genetic and genomic interpretation software, automation tools and instrumentation. With LIMSABC we built a modern, flexible cloud solution on a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Python) stack.\nReasons we went cloud with our LIS:  Infrastructure on demand. Building, maintaining and securing your own data center is a costly undertaking; we felt that most clients would be better served if we used truly world class web service providers such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft. In addition, these large vendors have HIPAA business associate agreements and processes to ensure your data is handled appropriately. Fully redundant data systems. Your data is backed up in the cloud across redundant servers so it is extremely unlikely that you would lose any data. The web service providers provide a number of services that would easily allow you to replicate any internal processes. World class uptime and accessibility to your information. When was the last time your gmail wasn’t available? Or you couldn’t shop on Amazon? Extreme scalability of users, samples and peak system load. The upper limit of bandwidth available from in-house servers is a fraction of the bandwidth available from cloud providers. The cloud gives you the processing power you need when you need it; you are freed from having to build your own data center for peak demand. Access from any device, anywhere. With a full, cloud based system all you need is a web browser to access your data. Reduction of your in-house IT burden through a fully hosted and supported system. LIMSABC as Software as a Service means no need to host software locally for your LIS system. All you need is a modern web browser such as Chrome or Safari.  Learn more LIMSABC for Toxicology\n",
